 People with partial awareness of negative effects of climate change; age group 10 - 40 years; with access to a laptop or mobile; 

 Rise temperature by 4 deg: hurricanes, heatwaves, oceans rise, climate-induced conflicts. Simulate any scenario now to prevent it later!


Climate change is the biggest problem humanity faces right now.          
Year 2050: temperature rose by 2degrees; Hurricanes, extreme heatwaves, fewer insects, withering crops, climate-induced refugees, 
climate-economic losses are "daily events".            
Year 2100: temperature rose by 4degrees; No polar ice, no coral reef, dying biodiversity, climateinduced conflicts and warfare are "daily events".
Don't you recognize this world? This is "our world" if we do not take action.        
Worse case scenarios? No.        
Unavoidable trajectory? No. 

How to educate and raise awareness?      
As data scientists we believe data science is not just collecting data/ visualizations/ predictions - is about insights and data storytelling.              
We propose a game; a serious game; an applied educational game. A multi-agent system simulator supporting many scenarios.       
EU datasets: Greenhouse gas emissions, Temperatures evolution from pre-industrial period, Meteorological events, Climate change mitigation policies.

In the simulation the Student:          
    - grants funds to research and implement thousands of innovative futuristic technologies: cementfree concrete, CO2-fueled bioplastics, algae bioreactors            - implements agreements and policies.       
The simulation reproduces economic losses from weather disasters from historical data until 2019; uses predictive models afterwards.
We process 4 datasets and create 2 scenarios.      
Lose conditions:               
    - Temperature rises above 4 degrees        
    - Sea rises above 1.5m           
    - 6 EU countries leave the Paris Agreement UNFCCC      
Win conditions:               
    - reach year 2150
AIception has a strong Datascience team:  successful pilot for Volkswagen (predictive maintenance)& BRD bank (OCR 4 million Romanian IDcards).               
Open source Game engine; entity-component-system supporting a data-oriented design; easily pluggable new stories/ scenarios/ datasets.
